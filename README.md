# Wellbeing-Factors
This project analyzes global happiness using panel data from 123 countries (2008â€“2019). It explores how economic (GDP, unemployment) and social factors (LGBT acceptance, peace, social support) influence well-being. The goal is to inform public policy beyond traditional economic metrics.

The goal is to understand how these variables interact and contribute to well-being, providing insights that can inform public policy beyond traditional economic growth metrics.

# Key Features
Panel Data Analysis: This project utilizes panel data to capture both between-country differences and within-country changes over time.

Fixed-Effects Model: A fixed-effects regression model is used to control for unobservable country-specific characteristics.

Interaction Terms: The analysis explores the interaction between GDP per capita and social support, providing insights into how these factors jointly affect happiness.
