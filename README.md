# Wellbeing-Factors
This project analyzes global happiness using panel data from 123 countries (2008â€“2019). It explores how economic (GDP, unemployment) and social factors (LGBT acceptance, peace, social support) influence well-being. The goal is to inform public policy beyond traditional economic metrics.
